# Scanning White Light Interferometry

PURPOSE

This project makes use of white light interference patterns (fringes) to deduce the surface elevation profile of a specimen. These fringes are created using a Michelson interferometer which consists of two optical paths: beamsplitter-mirror-beamsplitter (reference arm) and beamsplitter-specimen-beamsplitter (sample arm). Interference patterns are photographed by a camera, while a piezo actuator attached to the mirror holder changes the reference optical path sequentially.

IMPLEMENTATION

The above sequential image acquisition scheme requires a synchronization between the camera and the piezo actuator. This is managed by a Arduino microcontroller indirectly driving the piezo actuator with code written in C/C++ and a computer directly controlling the camera and the Arduino with code written in Python via USB cables.

PACKAGE CODES

Python

This package offers two ways of carrying out measurement and analysis of a specimen:
  1) Via an integrated GUI that sets up the camera configurations, calibrates the piezo actuator, displaying specimen images live, acquires image sets and produces the surface elevation profile of the specimen. It also contains some auxiliary functionalities for the setting of the interferometer arms.
  2) Each aforementioned step can be executed separately via the corresponding python scripts. (See file descriptions)
  
  C/C++
  
  There are two different Arduino codes: one used for oscillating the piezo actuator back and forth for fringe viewing purposes only and one used for the measurement process.

Creating an environment from the "environment.yml" file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

1.	Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
	The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name.

	$ conda env create -f environment.yml

2. 	Activate the new environment:
		
	$ conda activate myenv

	[Note: Replace myenv with the environment name]

3.	Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

	$ conda list

­­­Installing Spinnaker SDK with PySpin libraries
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Except for the required packages mentioned in the environment.yml file, there are two last files that must be downloaded and installed.

- From https://www.ptgrey.com/ : Support -> Downloads
- Select Product Family, Camera Model and Operating System
- Select Software spoiler tab -> Spinnaker 1.13.0.33 Full SDK
(develop new applications using USB3 or GigE Vision cameras)
                                              -> Spinnaker 1.13 for Python 2 and 3
(access all USB3 and GigE Vision cameras in Python using the PySpin python wrapper for Spinnaker)

- Run SpinnakerSDK_FULL_x.x.x.x application and install all the contained drivers and Visual Studio redistributables.
- Open spinnaker_python-1.13.0.33-amd64\spinnaker_python-1.13.0.33-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.zip and extract spinnaker_python-1.13.0.33-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl to a folder.

In Anaconda Prompt:
- Activate the newly created environment if not already ( $ conda activate myenv )
  $ cd <full path to the folder containing the wheel file>
  $ pip install spinnaker_python-1.13.0.33-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
- Ready! Any .py file can be executed now in the Spyder IDE or in the command prompt.


Notes:
- Spinnaker and PySpin versions must match.
- The above installation is for Python 3.6. For the 2.7 or 3.5 versions, select spinnaker_python-x.x.x.x-cp27__ or spinnaker_python-x.x.x.x-cp35__ respectively.
